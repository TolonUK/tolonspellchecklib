English (Australian) Dictionary for OpenOffice.org version 1.1.0
The word list has been expanded by merging in the words from the latest en_GB dictionary,
New words have been added from publicly available new word lists.
Some words from New Zealand eEnglish added. More Australianisms have been added  
like 'drongo, truckie, chunder'.

Phonetic spelling suggestions have been improved by copying the 
definitions from the en_US dictionary.  Some of these may not be so appropiate for Aaustralian English I would like to hear about suggested improvments. See the en_AU.aff file for details.

Taboo words are now not suggested. There are only 3, they are the ones marked with a "!" in the en_AU.dic file.

Various missing words and contractions like "should?ve, might?ve, how?d, how'll, how've, where'll, where've, why'd, why'll, why've" reported to OpenOffice as bug reports have been added.

'Gotten' was removed as 'US English,' got is suggested instead.

English (Australian) Dictionary for OpenOffice.org version 1.0.0

This dictionary was based on the Australian English Dictionary 
available from http://lingucomponent.openoffice.org/spell_dic.html 
(Licensed under the LGPL.) In turn, that dictionary was based on 
the en_GB Myspell dictionary which in turn was initially based on 
a subset of the original English wordlist created by Kevin Atkinson 
for Pspell and Aspell (also initially licensed under the LGPL.) 

Cameron Roy made some improvements, described in the changelog.txt  
file, and packaged the improved  dictionary for the Australian 
Dictionary Firefox extension. 

David Wilson packaged Cameron Roy's Firefox dictionary into this 
OpenOffice.org extension: dict-en-au.oxt.
